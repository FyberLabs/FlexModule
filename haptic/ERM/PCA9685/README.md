A Flex Module is a tiny breakout board that is both breadboard-able and designed to solder/epoxy to flexible PCB for wearable prototyping.  

This is a PCA9685 in a Flex Module. The driver is configured to source 10mA per channel. In this configuration it can drive 16 LEDs that can utilize 10mA as well as drive servos utilizing PWM. In addition, with common ULN2803A Darlington arrays it can source vibration or other 100mA motors.

This Flex Module will work with any ERM motor sold by [Fyber Labs](https://www.fyberlabs.com).
