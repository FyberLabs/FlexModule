Qi/USB Charger Flex Module
================================

This is the hardware design repository from Fyber Labs.  For more information on
the project, please see the
[hackaday page](http://hackaday.io/project/2849-qi-and-usb-li-charger-flex-module).
This project is part of the Flex Modules being developed
for general wearable designs.  For more information about Flex Modules, please see the hackaday page.

This is a new design as ST Micro has decided to EOL their fuel gauge.  So this will utilize a TI 
http://www.ti.com/product/bq27531-g1 which has tighter integration with the BQ24296.
